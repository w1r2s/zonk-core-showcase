# ðŸŽ² Zonk Core Showcase

![.NET CI](https://github.com/w1r2s/zonk-core-showcase/actions/workflows/dotnet.yml/badge.svg)

A showcase of **core logic and AI strategy** for the dice game *Zonk (Farkle)*, implemented in **C# / .NET 8**.  
This repository contains only the **algorithmic layer** â€” without Unity scenes or assets.

---

## ðŸ§© Overview

The project demonstrates:

- Modular architecture (Core + Tests)
- Scoring and turn logic system
- Multiple AI agents with distinct behaviors
- Full **xUnit** test suite with CI integration
- FSM-based adaptive decision-making

---

## ðŸ¤– AI Strategies

The project implements four autonomous agents:

- **AggressiveAI** â€” pushes for a high per-turn score; continues rolling while risk is acceptable, often targeting â‰¥600 points and occasionally chasing extra gain.  
- **ConservativeAI** â€” prefers steady progress; banks early once a minimal safe score (â‰ˆ300â€“1500 pts) is achieved or few dice remain.  
- **CautiousAI** â€” greedily takes **all available scoring combinations** on the roll and **ends the turn** (no rerolls); emphasizes guaranteed gain over exploration.  
- **FSMAdaptiveAI** â€” hybrid finite-state agent that switches between Aggressive and Conservative modes depending on game context (score difference, zonks, etc.).

| Agent            | Roll behavior                          | Banking policy                    |
|------------------|----------------------------------------|-----------------------------------|
| AggressiveAI     | Continues if risk acceptable            | Banks on high gain / low dice     |
| ConservativeAI   | Rerolls only with enough dice left      | Banks early (safe thresholds)     |
| CautiousAI       | Takes **all** scoring combos, no reroll | **Immediately banks**             |
| FSMAdaptiveAI    | Depends on current mode                 | Inherits modeâ€™s policy            |
